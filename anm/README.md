# aatonnomicc node manager

Welcome to ANM  - experimental so feed back is welcome 

This script will control the number of nodes running on an ubuntu system saving time trying to guess how many nodes to start.

The script will be installed by selecting start nodes option

This will install the anms.sh script in /usr/bin and set the script to run on a 1 min cron schedule
On first startup it will ask for

1. Port range default is set at 55 which means first node will start on port 55001 and iterate up from there.
2. ETH Rewards Address
3. Node Cap - How many nodes to start
4. Node Start Interval - sets delay in minnutes bettwen starting nodes
5. Node Upgrade Interval - sets delay in minnutes bettwen upgrading nodes

After first run a config file is created at /var/antctl/config.

Edit any of these settings manualy to control anm if you need to change the default values.
If you wish fully automatic upgrades of nodes set 
```NodeVersion="--version 0.110.0"```
to
```NodeVersion=""``` and the upgrade will start at the upgrade hour and minnute.

## Donation enabled

By default, the first node of each server is marked for a donation wallet. The standard wallet address targetted is the [ANT Faucet](https://ant.xd7.org).

The donation target wallet address can be changed by setting ```DonateAddress="0x..."``` in the file $HOME/.local/share/anm-wallet

# In Action

It can be seen here that system load started increasing at 07:00 for all machines runing anm.

and here is total node count showing the number of running nodes decreasing to keep the load in the defined range.

# prereq

1. A non-root user account must exist.

```
adduser <username>
usermod -aG sudo <username>
su <username>
cd (make sure and do the cd to change to correct home folder !!!)
```

2. User account must be able to do sudo actions without password.

```
#set up sudo access without password
sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/*
sudo echo -e -n ''$USER' ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/10-users
```
3. Antup & antnode must be installed.

```
#install ant up
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maidsafe/antup/main/install.sh | sudo bash
close teminal and reopen to add antup to the path after install
antup node
```
4. All nodeports closed in UFW firewall script will open and close ports as needed.

# to run anm

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safenetforum-community/NTracking/main/anm/anm-local.sh)
```

# monitoring

1. Ntracking prefered way to monitor 
2. to manualy view the log file ```tail -f /var/antctl/log```  This refreshes once per minnute when ams is running.

# Stopping nodes

just select stop nodes option from the script and on next run it will

1. stop all nodes
2. delete all node files
2. delete all scripts and cron jobs
3. close all fire wall ports used
4. reboot the system

# If it all goes wong

1. manualy stop and clear out everything
```
sudo rm /etc/cron.d/anm
sudo systemctl stop antnode*
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/safenode*
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo rm -rf /var/log/safenode
sudo rm -rf /var/antctl
sudo rm -f /usr/bin/anms.sh
sudo rm -f /etc/cron.d/scrape
sudo rm -f /usr/bin/scrape.sh
```

2. sort firewall out if rules are left over

adjust for your ssh port if not using port 22 and keep 8086 open on machine running NTracking and also keep open for any other services running on the system.

```
sudo ufw disable
echo "y" | sudo ufw reset
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp comment 'SSH'
sudo ufw allow 8086/tcp comment 'influxdb'
echo "y" | sudo ufw enable
```
then give system a reboot just for good luck also it will reset all load levels to zero

```
sudo reboot
```
